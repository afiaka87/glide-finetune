# DEPRECATED - Use pyproject.toml with uv instead
# This file is kept for backward compatibility only
# 
# To install dependencies, use:
#   uv sync
#
# The actual dependencies are defined in pyproject.toml
# with the following key packages:
#   - torch>=2.0.0 (NOT 1.10.1 as was here before)
#   - accelerate>=0.25.0 (for multi-GPU support)
#   - webdataset>=0.2.0
#
# See pyproject.toml for the complete and up-to-date dependency list
